# Design

This directory contains some design artifacts. This is mostly initial design
work. The details of the design are unlikely to keep pace with the
implementation.

## UML Diagrams

The UML diagrams are written for [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/). This is a
tool that converts text representations of UML diagrams to graphical
representations. The SVG images should match the corresponding UML source files.
If you want to render your own, though, just
[install and run PlantUML](http://plantuml.com/starting).
