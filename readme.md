This library has a few goals:

- Provide a C++ implementation that uses C++11 or later.
- Provide a C++ implementation that uses C++ best practices.
- Provide an implementation that uses C++ through and through; an implementation
  that is not a wrapper around some other language implementation.
- Provide an implementation that minimizes dependencies on other libraries.
